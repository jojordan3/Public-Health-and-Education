## A Small Area Analysis into NYC's Many Diverse Communities

Here, I aggregate, analyze and visualize many variables (primarily relating to demographic and socioeconomic information, education, individual health, healthcare access, and indicators of community well-being) of different Community Districts (CDs) in New York City (NYC), as outlined by the Community Boards of New York City.

*Small area analysis is a methodology that seeks to uncover disparities among subpopulations within a larger whole.*

## Social Progress: Making Data Public and Transparency

In June 2018, when I first attempted this project (which began as a as a personal project for [LambdaSchool](https://learn.lambdaschool.com/)'s Machine Learning--now Data Science--Program).
), there was extraordinarily little data publicly available for small area analysis, which I discussed in [this blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/finding-meaning-the-data-problem-with-small-area-predictive-analysis-in-the-social-sciences-part-9fba1e2c981b) on Medium.

Since then, there has been an explosion of data made available by New York City thanks to NYC Local Law 11, or the "Open Data Law", passed in 2012, which mandated that all public data be made freely available via a single portal by the end of 2018. (Find out more [here](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/open-data-law/).)

The data has been collected from the following sources:

- [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) launched in 2018
- [DATA2GO.NYC](www.data2go.nyc) first launched in 2016\*
- [DATA2GOHEALTH.NYC](www.data2gohealth.nyc) launched in 2018\*
- IPUMS USA, University of Minnesota [www.ipums.org](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/)\*\*

\* DATA2GO.NYC and DATA2GOHEALTH.NYC are projects by [Measure of America](http://measureofamerica.org/), an initiative adopted by the [Social Science Research Council](https://www.ssrc.org/) in 2008.
\*\* I was able to use thanks to [this map](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/nyc-population/census2010/puma_cd_map.pdf) (courtesy of [nyc.gov]), which maps Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) to NYC's Community Districs (CDs)
